## HW8 **Bitcoin Scripts and Lightning Network**

Written by Akash Khosla (Blockchain at Berkeley).

In lecture, we covered a high-level overview of Bitcoin Scripting and the Lightning Network.

For this week, we'll be taking a break from programming and will take some time to play with some demos and write on the design of these protocols.

To learn about the latest developments in Blockchain protocols, it is oftentimes important to listen to talks, read whitepapers, and blogposts. Here are a few resources I recommend to fortify your understanding of the components involved.

These are in recommended order. If you only pick one, do the first talk by Dan. If you're interested in more cross chain stuff, I recommend checking out Summa One's light client proofs, the Cosmos IBC protocol, Polkadot Network and Interledger.
