    "One of the most contentious issues in the Blockchain space concerns the independence and stability of the transaction validators that participate in the consensus protocol. In Proof-of-Work (PoW) Blockchains these _validators_ are called **miners**. The specialization and centralization of mining across different PoW systems has been well documented in the last few years. High centralization of mining, undermines the central premise of blockchain systems by making the system: \n",
    "1. more vulnerable to central points of failure and \n",
    "2. more vulnerable to the larger miners manipulating transactions on their behalf (see [Selfish Mining](https://www.binance.vision/glossary/selfish-mining), [51% Attacks](https://www.binance.vision/security/what-is-a-51-percent-attack) and [Transaction Frontrunning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Eventhough the individual mining power can be readily observed by looking at how many blocks has each miner mined, there might still exist collusion agreements or other types of relationships between miners, that are less aparent. This notebook intents to explore transactions between miners in Ethereum to try to characterize potential relationships between miners. \n",
